## Features

- Generates a list of random numbers.
- Allows you to select from the following sorting algorithms:
  - Bubble Sort
  - Insertion Sort
  - Quick Sort
  - Merge Sort
  - Selection Sort
  - Radix Sort
- Sorts the list and displays the sorted numbers.
- Measures and displays the sorting time in seconds.
- Provides a reset option to clear the results and start over.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Tkinter (usually included with Python)
